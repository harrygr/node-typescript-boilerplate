# Node TypeScript Starter

A simple bit of boilerplate to start hacking away with TypeScript.

Includes Jest for running your tests.

## Usage

### Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/harrygr/node-typescript-boilerplate.git
$ cd node-typescript-boilerplate
```

You'll probably want to delete the `.git` directory so you can start a fresh repo

```
$ rm -rf .git
```

### Install the dependencies

```
$ yarn install
```

### Hack Away

Your code will live in the `src/` directory. Tests can also live there and be named `*.spec.ts` or `*.test.ts`.

See package.json for available commands. But `yarn test` and `yarn build` are the main ones.
